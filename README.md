## **Usage**

1.Run Project

-> Clone the project locally using Git/ or unarchive the zip and execute 'docker-compose up' in the docker folder.

-> Access http://localhost:3000 to see the frontend app
-> Backed server will be accesible on http://localhost:8080

-> The docker folder contains an 'app' folder and a docker-compose file. Inside the 'app' folder, 
you can find the backend JAR, the 'dist' folder generated by the React build, the configuration 
file for the Nginx server, and the application.properties file used to define backend code settings.

## **Project structure**

-> satellite-backend - Server written in Java with Spring Boot and Postgres for the database.
                     - Java 17 is required to compile the code
 
                     - Execute mvn clean package to execute tests and generate the JAR file

-> satellite-frontend - Frontend part written in React with TypeScript, Redux for state management, 
Vite for build and development server, and Yarn for dependency management. The design incorporates 
components imported from mui.com.

                      - Execute yarn install than yarn build to generate the 'dist' folder with the sources

## **Project description**

-> Create satellites with specific coordinates and view them in a list component on the sidebar and on a map. 
The map is interactive, and clicking on a satellite will display its description.

## **Project Trade-offs**
-> The search bar implementation is limited to the frontend. This means that the search function filters 
the current entries on the client-side without making a request to the server.
